My research and writing is interdisciplinary, informed by sociocultural theory, science studies, discourse analysis, posthumanisms and poststructural theory. While I primarily locate myself as a researcher at the interstice of literacy and technology studies, I also contribute to the learning sciences and to re-considerations of theory and method in interpretive inquiry. The purpose of this website is primarily to make my work accessible to different audiences and for those wanting to follow up on special interests. I have divided my writing into five sections below. While many pieces of writing apply to more than section, I hope this organization will help you find what you’re most interested in.  


## Sections
